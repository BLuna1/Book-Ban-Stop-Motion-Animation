          <h1> The Book Ban Stop Motion Animation 
              <p> The Book Ban Stop Motion Animation is about the affect and massive inpact that book bans have on our socity and how it restricts people of all ages from knowing the truth behind many historical events.

              <p2> Our animations shows how book bans affect a younger audience and how these bans restrict this young girl Kiki from being able to learn about different topics and ideas that are banned and removed from the publics eye. Kiki ultimatly overcomes her issue within the animation and shares the book to more people.

          <h2> The Process 
              <p3> We started off with our 5 Whys as to why books banded so we asked-
                   Why do books get banned?
                   Why is it important for books to be banned?
                   Why do people want book bans?
                  
              <p4> We ultimatly decided that our main cause was "Why is it important for books to not be banned?"

             <h3> Why Is It Important?
              <p5> It is important because some banned books explain the reality of certain subjects like racism, sexism, etc and without those books, people now or in future generations wouldnâ€™t understand the reason why some subjects are as important as they are and need to be talked about.
